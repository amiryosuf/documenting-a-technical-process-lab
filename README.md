# Documenting A Technical Process Lab - Updating macOS on Apple MacBooks and iMacs
This documentation details the process of Updating macOS on a MacBook or iMac. The same steps can be followed for an OS upgrade as well

## Requirements
- An Apple MacBook or iMac device that is not obsolete
- Connection to a power source, or a MacBook that is at least on 50% battery
- 50gb of available storage space on the internal storage drive
- A recent backup of the device, or most important files
- Strong internet connection
- Admin account privileges

## Before The Update
Before beginning the software update, consider the following steps to ensure that data is secure and that common issues can be avoided.

### 1. Backup Data
    - Many Apple users use Time Machine for full backups of their disk on external drives, and iCloud to save a smaller selection of files located on the desktop and documents folder. To ensure these methods are used, use the following steps.
    - iCloud: **"Settings"** -> **"Apple Account/Apple ID"** -> **"iCloud"** -> **"iCloud Drive"** -> Toggle the **"Desktop & Docuemnts Folders"** setting.
    - iMac & MacBook: **"Time Machine App"** -> **"Select External Disk"** -> **"Start Backup"**.

### 2. Ensure Sufficient Storage Available
    - Ensure at least 50gb of internal storage space is available after the OS update file has been downloaded.
    - Insufficuent storage space can lead to interrupted updates, which may require further troubleshooting to operate the device.


## Updating macOS
This section outlines the step-by-step process to check for and install the most up-to-date version of macOS on your iMac or MacBook.

### 1. Open System Settings
    - Select the **"Apple Logo"** on the top-left corner of the menu bar
    - Select **"System Settings"**.
### 2. Navigate to Software Update
    - Select **"General"** on the panel along the left side of **System Settings**
    - Select **"Software Update"**.
## 3. Select **Check for and Download Update** 
    - Select **Check for Update** if the **"Automatic Updates"** section has not been toggled to **"On"**.
    - Download the newest OS and/or Security Response updates if available.
    - To ensure that new updates are downloaded when available, select **Automatic Updates** and toggle on **"Download new updates when available"**. This section also contains the ability for macOS and application updates from the app store to occur automatically.
## 4. Begin the Update
    - Select **"Update Now"** or **"Upgrade Now"**. The selection available to you depends on whether you're updating the OS or performing a system upgrade.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions that follow, which may include entering the administrator password.
    - The process can take anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour, depending on the size of the update or upgrade. Updates and upgrades on older iMacs and MacBook can take upwards towards two hours at most. The device may restart multiple times throughout the process, which is normal. The process will complete when the device boots up to the user login screen.
## 5. Verify the Update
    - Select the Apple logo on the top left corner of the menu bar. Select **"About This Mac"**, and the current version of macOS will be displayed.
